# Analyzing-NYC-High-School-Data
New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.
New York City has published data on [student SAT scores by high school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4), along with additional demographic data sets.
I have combined several datasets such as [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4),[School Attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statistics-by-Dis/7z8d-msnt),
[Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3),[AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/AP-College-Board-2010-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e),
[Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-School-Le/vh2h-md7a),[Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Demographics-and-Accountability-Snapshot-20/ihfw-zy9j),[School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYC-School-Survey-2011/mnz3-dyi8)
to facilitate the analysis.
